While there is a lot of debate on the decentralised aspect of Web 3, it is not without its own structures and rules (also called as smart contracts and such). At PRSPR we are looking to onboard all such individuals who truly resonate with the idea of a shared earth, shared prosperity. 

While efforts by these groups have immensely helped a number of organizations, most of the work has either been pioneered by technology companies, academic initiatives or by multilateral bodies. This of in itself is not a bad idea, however, the organizations and people working closely with problems on the ground have the best vantage point to enable this change.

As such the early adopters and people who bring substantial development of PRSPR with major skin in the game later will be called as Pioneers who will set the rules of contracts and transactions. Their contribution to the community has to be substantial in terms of building the governance rules or managing the community and should be revocable every two years unless given the status again through voting.

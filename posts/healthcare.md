## Background
<p>Health Insurance in India is broken. <u>780 million of Indians can’t or won’t buy health insurance for an array of reasons and those who buy it</u>, rarely, have a good experience. COVID affected hospitalisations was a recent testimony as to how many insurance buyers were treated, when it came to claims. Insurance moved out of communities, to make itself more viable, by adding more individual risks to the pool, but in doing so, it created mis aligned incentives and inefficiencies. Mis aligned incentives in product design and resulting inefficiencies in this three-player model (insurer-insured-care providers) insuring mostly hospitalization, results in parties winning at the cost of the other and in doing so creates distrust and premium cost escalation. </p>
<p>Health is a unique risk in that it is a personal one very much dependent on the person. To pay for such a personal risk via an indirectly pooled model has been always seen as a grey zone-often exploited by different stakeholders in the health insurance ecosystem in myriad ways. Managing very large directly pooled risk (shared/mutual/cooperative) has been a problem many have tried to solve in the past with varying degrees of success. It requires a strong governance and good governance practices, that are expensive and time taking, and for a country like India where the costs must be low, they become a bottleneck to scale.</p>
<p>With 67 insurers (indirect pools) for a 1.4 billion population and 60% of total health expenses in India being paid out of pocket, the argument for health insurance is a no brainer. Yet over 780 million people are still out of any health protection either given by the State or after buying from the market. We seek to change that. We seek to bring the aligned incentives of the community model and the ability to scale across communities and individuals without the inefficiencies and misalignment that traditional insurance is plagued with.</p>

## How can we re-imagine this?
We propose to think of this as a DAO, and are in the process of setting up an experiment to evaluate how well it can function.

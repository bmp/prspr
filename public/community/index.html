<p>While there is a lot of debate on the decentralised aspect of Web 3,<br>
it is not without its own structures and rules (also called as smart<br>
contracts and such). At PRSPR we are looking to onboard all such<br>
individuals who truly resonate with the idea of a shared earth, shared<br>
prosperity.</p>
<p>While efforts by these groups have immensely helped a number of<br>
organizations, most of the work has either been pioneered by<br>
technology companies, academic initiatives or by multilateral bodies.<br>
This of in itself is not a bad idea, however, the organizations and<br>
people working closely with problems on the ground have the best<br>
vantage point to enable this change.</p>
<p>As such, the early adopters and members who contribute to PRSPR will<br>
have major skin in the game, and will later be called as Pioneers who<br>
will set the rules of contracts and transactions. Their contribution<br>
to the community has to be substantial in terms of building the<br>
governance rules or managing the community and should be revocable<br>
every two years unless given the status again through voting.</p>

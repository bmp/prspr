**"Participation", "Inclusive", "Equitable", "Collaboration" &amp; "Sustainable"**

We would say 'motherhood and mysorepak', all of us agree that these are important principles, but the challenge is how do we get there. Pick any organization in the <i>social</i> space, and they will have one of these terms (if not more) as the founding principles. Many fol**x** have worked tirelessly to institutionalize these ideas and grapple with the nuances that stem from the diverse spaces we inhabit. In recent times, technology has often been posited as yet another obstacle for all of us to grapple with. Like any other tool, technology too can be harnessed to help achieve these principles or to consolidate the power differences.

The founders met at an Ashoka Fellows get together and have been discussing various ideas around communities, social protection, capitalism, the development space and the rapid use of technology in financial inclusion. Between the founding team, they have over three decades of experience in making the world a better place for everyone.

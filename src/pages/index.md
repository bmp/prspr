## Welcome

We hope this message finds you in good spirits. We wish to invite you to participate in an exciting experiment centred on building digital public infrastructure for common pool resources. At a time when financial inclusion has taken centre stage, we believe that pooling resources is a better alternative to the traditional lending and credit model, and we would like to take a moment to explain why.

The traditional lending and credit system, though widely used, is fraught with challenges, such as unequal distribution of resources, financial instability and a lack of dignity. Our experiment seeks to address these challenges by creating a more inclusive and equitable system. By pooling resources, individuals can collectively mitigate risks and share the benefits of their shared resources, leading to increased trust and accountability among participants.

Digital public infrastructure for common pool resources is an important step towards more sustainable and equitable management of our shared resources, and a key component of digital financial inclusion. With the advent of digital technology, we have an opportunity to leverage its power and create a transparent and accountable system for managing shared resources, promoting cooperation and mutual support among participants.

The experiment we are conducting seeks to build on this concept by creating a digital public infrastructure for managing a common pool resources. Participants will contribute a fixed amount of resources or funds to the pool on a regular basis. The community will decide on the claims collectively and the individuals will receive the payout on the same day. Our aim is to create a fair and transparent system that promotes collaboration and mutual support.

In conclusion, our experiment is a critical step towards building a more inclusive financial system that promotes digital financial inclusion. By participating, you will be contributing to the advancement of this important concept and to the well-being of society as a whole.

Thank you for considering this invitation, please do join us to make this a success.

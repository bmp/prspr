## Welcome

We trust this message finds you in good spirits.

We wish to invite you to participate in a path-breaking experiment centred on building digital public infrastructure for common pool resources.

At a time when financial inclusion has taken centre stage, we believe that pooling resources can solve the issues created by traditional lending, credit models and even insurance models, and we wish to take a moment to explain why.

The traditional lending and credit system, though widely used, is fraught with challenges, such as exploitation, unequal distribution of resources, financial instability and a lack of dignity. Similarly, insurance is riddled with fraud and moral hazard on the one hand and low acceptability in paying humongous premiums by a large section of society in today's volatile world.

Our experiment seeks to address these challenges by creating a more inclusive and equitable system. By pooling resources in real-time, individuals can collectively pay for asks, leading to increased trust and accountability among participants.

Digital public infrastructure for common pool resources is an important step towards a more sustainable and equitable management of our shared resources, and a key component of digital financial inclusion and growth. With the advent of digital technology, we have an opportunity to leverage its power and create a transparent and accountable system for managing shared resources, promoting cooperation and mutual support among participants.

The experiment we are conducting seeks to build on this concept by creating a digital public infrastructure for managing a common pool resources. Participants will contribute a fixed amount of resources or funds to the pool on a regular basis. The community will decide on the ask collectively and the individuals will receive the payout on the same day. Our aim is to create a fair and transparent system that promotes collaboration and mutual support.

When you participate in this experiment, you contribute to building a new paradigm of financial transaction, one that is *inclusive*, *equitable*, *non-exploitative* and immensely useful to *everyone* participating.

We are offering limited seats as part of the experiment and you can join us.

In its most pristine form, nature does not discriminate-it may differentiate but not discriminate. For example, a water source is available to every organism for consumption to survive. From lions to birds to deers', crocodiles to the fish living in it.

While enterprises led to a new world order with the human at the centre of it, the creation of wealth has been sub optimal and its distribution is, still work in progress, though we have come a long way.

We are building a resource commons. A commons that looks at the future of money and opens up access to it (money) to people, regardless of who they are. It does away with the lender-debtor transaction as the people participating in the commons share the risk together (as in insurance). It also does away with the process and burden of verification of the ask (considered indispensable to all financial transactions) relying on the goodness of non offenders and the ability of the commons to identify and extricate the cost of non-compliance from the offenders when required. A commons', that supports asks' for health expense, school fees, college tuition fees and such needs going forward. A commons where participating daily makes all the difference and not credit worthiness !

Participants to PRSPR would use a daily wallet system to pay for the asks that originate that day. The remainder would be returned to their wallet. It would inform the participant as to how many people received benefits thanks to their contribution.

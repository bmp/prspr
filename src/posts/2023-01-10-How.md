We are building this as a new advanced version of a mutual/cooperative. We are building this through a first adopters model within a closed community. Since the risks to the model are high and governance on the fly is under construction we want to limit our exposure.

We are building this at scale not in numbers but in value alignment. A large number of people who believe in pooling their risks together as it makes financial and ethical sense.
